The aim of this project is to predict the ripening of tomatoes kept in cold storage. 
The project will enable people to monitor the health of tomatoes and other such fruits/vegatables for optimal storage and trade, using ML.

Data:
Temperature
Pressure
Relative Humididty
CO2
Ethylene

Ethylene helps to determine the onset and rate of ripening of the tomato.

This prject implements an LSTM to predict trends in Ethylene level.
